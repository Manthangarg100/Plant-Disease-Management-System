# Plant-Disease-Management-System
THis is The Plant Disease Detection System for Sustainable Agriculture aims to address a critical challenge in modern farming: the early and accurate detection of plant diseases. Crop diseases can lead to significant yield losses and increased reliance on chemical pesticides, which harm the environment. This project proposes a solution using machine learning and image processing techniques to automatically identify and classify plant diseases based on leaf images and created using python frameworks like pandas , matplotlib, ceras , tenserflow and many more . By providing farmers with a tool to detect diseases early, the system helps in minimizing pesticide use, improving crop health, and promoting more sustainable farming practices. The project aims to build a user-friendly system
